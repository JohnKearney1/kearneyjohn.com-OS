                Iâ€™m a multidisciplinary musician and computer science student at Appalachian State University in North Carolina.

                    My music work revolves largely around production, songwriting and engineering for artists in a variety of genres,
                    spanning bedroom pop, drum and bass and southern trap. My production is influenced by more than a decade of formal
                    training playing classical and jazz piano and percussion.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                My computer science projects span web3, financial analysis, penetration testing, web design and development,
                systems architecture, automated marketing tools, Virtual Studio Technology (VST) applications and more.
                </p>

                    Thanks for checking out my stuff.
